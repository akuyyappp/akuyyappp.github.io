        social media account. We also collect some data automatically, like information about your device and what parts of our Services you interact
        with or spend time using.
      </p>
      <h4>2.1 Data You Provide to Us</h4>
      <p>* The data listed above is stored by us and associated with your account in our Services.</p>
      <p>
        ●Account Data: In order to use certain features (registering for an account), you need to create a user account. When you create or update
        your account, we collect and store the data you provide, like your name, gender, and date of birth, and assign you a unique identifying number
        (“Account Data”).
      </p>
      <p>
        ●Profile Data: You can also choose to provide profile information like a photo, info, name, sexual interests, or other data. Your Profile Data
        will be publicly viewable by others unless you delete your account. To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to
        access your camera or photo album. Some of the information you choose to provide us may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in a certain
        jurisdiction, for example, your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation, and religious beliefs. By choosing to provide this information,
        you consent to our processing of that information.
      </p>
      <p>
        ●Usage Data: When you use our Services and features, we collect certain data including; messages, follow information, photos, videos, and
        other user data. Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the operation of the
        Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        ●Shared Content: Parts of the Services let you interact with other users or share content publicly, including by videos you post and the data
        you provided in your profile. Such shared content may be publicly viewable by others depending on where it is posted.
      </p>
      <p>
        ●Promotions: When you choose to participate in our promotions, events, or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or
        enter. If you won a prize, we would collect the financial information to reward you.
      </p>
      <p>
        ●Data About Your Accounts on Other Services: We may obtain certain information through your social media or other online accounts if they are
        connected to your account in our Services. If you login to our Services via Facebook or another third-party platform, we ask for your
        permission to access certain information about that other account. For example, depending on the platform or service we may collect your name,
        profile picture, gender, info, and birthday.
        <br />
        Those platforms and services make information available to us through their APIs. The information we receive depends on what information you
        (via your privacy settings) or the platform or service decide to give us.
        <br />
        If you access or use our Services through a third-party platform or service, or click on any third-party links, the collection, use, and
        sharing of your data will also be subject to the privacy policies and other agreements of that third party.
      </p>
      <p>
        ●Data About Paid Service: All our paid service is through Android platforms. We only receive a receipt of your transaction provided by these
        platforms. For security reasons, we do not collect or store sensitive cardholder data, such as full credit card numbers or card authentication
        data.
      </p>
      <p>
        ●Communications and Support: If you contact us for support or to report a problem or concern (regardless of whether you have created an
        account), we collect and store your contact information, messages, and other data about you such as your name, email address, location,
        operating system, IP address, and any other data you provide or that we collect through automated means (which we cover below). We use this
        data to respond to you and research your question or concern, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you ask us to communicate with or
        otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect
        the information about others that you give us in order to complete your request.
      </p>
      <p>
        ●Sensitive Information: Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your Profile such as your religious denomination
        and health details. While you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your Profile, including your sexual preferences
        and ethnic background, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs or any video clips that you post on our Services may
        reveal these kinds of sensitive personal data. Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive data about yourself, you are explicitly
        consenting to our processing your information and making this public to other users.
      </p>
      <h4>2.2. Data From Others</h4>

        features you’ve been using, search preferences, clicks, and pages which have been shown to you, referring web page address, advertising that
        you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users, you connect and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of

        various means, depending on the service and device you’re using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections. The collection of your
        geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren’t using the Services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such
        collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it. Similarly, if you consent, we may collect
        your photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo, video or streaming on the Services).

        platforms (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign’s success).

      </p>
      <h4>4.2 With Our Service Providers and Partners:</h4>
      <p>

      </p>

        information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising partners. We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any
        service provider or working with any partner. All of our service providers and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.

      <h4>4.3 When Required by Law:</h4>
      <p>
        We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search
        warrant, government/law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject
        in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.
      </p>
      <h4>4.4 To Enforce Legal Rights:</h4>
      <p>
        We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect
        our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and
        (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.
      </p>
      <h4>4.5 Monitor:</h4>
      <p>
        Moderators to monitor activity on the site/apps and approve content. Fraud prevention and anti-spam providers to protect the service from
        criminal activity.
      </p>
      <h4>4.6 Change of Control:</h4>
      <p>
        In the event that our Services or any of its affiliates undergoes a business transition or change of ownership, such as a merger, acquisition
        by another company, reorganization, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, or in the event of insolvency or administration, we may be
        required to disclose your personal data.
      </p>
      <h3>5. Your Rights</h3>
      <p>
        You have certain rights around the use of your data, including the ability to opt-out of cookies, and the collection of your data by certain
        analytics providers. You can update or terminate your account from within our Services, and can also contact us for individual rights requests
        about your personal data. We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following tools:
      </p>
      <p>
        ● Access / Update tools in the service: Tools and account settings that help you to access, rectify or delete information that you provided to
        us and that’s associated with your account directly within the service.
      </p>
      <p>
        ● Device permissions: Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone book and
        location services as well as push notifications. You can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the
        corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full
        functionality.
      </p>
      <p>● Deletion: You can delete your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service.</p>

      <p>We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points to remember:</p>
      <p>
        ●Reviewing your information: Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on
        the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms). You can request a copy of your
        personal information by sending us an email at aufihan@gmail.com.
      </p>

      <p>
        ● Updating your information: If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it
        and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its processing, please contact us via aufihan@gmail.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above
        requests. Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade
        secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. If you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy
        of any messages you received from him or her through our service, the other user will have to contact us to provide their written consent
        before the information is released.<br />
        Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests
        would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth.
      </p>
      <p>
        ●Uninstall: You can stop all information collected by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you
        uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the
        application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        ●Accountability: In certain countries, including in the European Union, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data
        protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. The data protection authority you can lodge a
        complaint with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where we are established.
      </p>
      <p>If you want to exercise any of your rights listed above please visit our feedback form or email us at aufihan@gmail.com.</p>

      <h3>6. Data Retention</h3>
      <p>
        We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable law. To protect
        the safety and security of our users on and off our Services, we implement a safety retention window of no longer than six months following
        account deletion unless there is a technical difficulty. During this period, some of your account information will be retained although the
        account will of course not be visible on the Services anymore. In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon the deletion of your
        account (following the safety retention window) or after a period of no longer than 5 years of continuous inactivity. An account is considered
        inactive when the Application of the Member has not established contact with XOXO Video Call’s servers (including due to deactivation of the
        geolocation process), and the Member has not used the Application. In any event, the Account of a Premium Member is not considered inactive.
        <br />
        Unless:
      </p>
      <p>
        ●we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some “traffic data” is kept for one year to comply with statutory data retention
        obligations) as well as to prevent bot systems that are abusing the system;
      </p>
      <p>
        ●we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for instance, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy Policy, and other
        similar consents are kept for five years);
      </p>
      <p>●there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved</p>
      <p>
        ●the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. For
        example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new
        account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anonymized information about activity on our Services is retained for longer periods of time for statistical and product research purposes but
        this is not attributable to an individual once the profile has been deleted. Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry
        out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific time frame
        due to technical constraints.
      </p>
      <h3>7. Data Protection and Security</h3>
      <p>
        ● We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all
        technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal
        information will always remain secure. Your password is an important part of our security system, and it is your responsibility to protect it.
        You should not share your password with any third party, and if you believe your password or account has been compromised, you should change
